Analyzing Liverpool Football Club: Historical Seasons, Player Market Values, and the 2019/2020 Premier League Championship

The analysis focused on Liverpool Football Club, examining historical seasons, player market values, and the historic 2019/2020 Premier League Championship. The goal was to gain insights into Liverpool's performance, identify key players, and predict future outcomes.

To analyze Liverpool's performance from 1993 to 2018, Premier League match results were used to calculate total goals scored, average goals per match, and distribution of wins, losses, and draws. Performance against specific opponents was also analyzed, revealing trends and patterns. Visualizations were employed to present the findings clearly.

The focus then shifted to Liverpool's 2019/2020 Premier League Championship-winning season. Datasets on defensive actions, passing, goalkeeping, goal and shot creation, and more were explored. Key metrics, such as top goal scorers and young players of the season, were identified. The best overall players were determined based on their contributions in goals, assists, and playing time. Radar graphs were used to compare Liverpool's goalkeepers.

A predictive model was developed to forecast the points table for the next Premier League season. A linear regression algorithm was employed, taking into account factors like team positions, recent scores, conceded goals, and points. The results provided insights into the potential performance of Liverpool and other teams in the upcoming season.

Alongside the analysis, a Tableau dashboard was created to visually present the data and enhance understanding of Liverpool's performance.

Overall, this project combined data analysis, visualization techniques, and predictive modeling to provide a comprehensive understanding of Liverpool Football Club. The analysis offered insights into the team's past performance, key players, and informed predictions for future seasons. The findings can be valuable for football enthusiasts, team management, and fans alike.
